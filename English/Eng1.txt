Theme 1 

It is very important to listen carefully when someone gives instructions so that you can 
carry out the instructions carefully, and reach the correct outcome. 
Listen to find out 
 
Prepositions 
A preposition shows where one thing is, in relation to  
another. Prepositions are used in instructions. 
E.g. Sit on the floor. 
Put this inside your bag. 
 

Sentences 

Simple sentences 
A simple sentence has only one verb and subject. 
E.g. Sit on the chair. Open the book. Peer out of the window. 

 
There are four types of sentences: 
• Statements - give information (full stop) 
• Questions - ask for information (question mark) 
• Commands - tell someone to do something (exclamation mark) 
• Exclamations - express a strong feeling or emotion (exclamation mark) 

 
Adverbs 
An adverb can describe an action (verb). 
 
An adverb can describe HOW an action happens.  
Example: Jason quickly read the book.  
How did Jason read? Quickly. 
An adverb can describe WHEN an action happens. 
Example: Emma left early.  
When did Emma leave? Early. 
An adverb can describe WHERE an action happens. 
Example: Lily and Ben played here. 
Where did Lily and Ben play? Here. 


Activity 5: Rewrite the following sentences into your workbook and underline (in
colour) the adverbs in each of the sentences. State each type of adverb.
1. Keep your ship firmly anchored in the secret cove.
2. The men must carry the treasure carefully.
3. Bury the treasure tomorrow.
4. The treasure was found near the tree.
5. The men always searched for the treasure.


lastly however finally
 although firstly
Activity 6: In your workbook, write 5 sentences with the connecting words above.
Begin each sentence with one of the connecting words.
 
Adverbs tell us more about verbs and adjectives. There are different types of adverbs:  
Adverbs of MANNER (ask how?) 
Adverbs of TIME (ask when?) 
Adverbs of PLACE (ask where?) 
Adverbs of DEGREE (ask how much/often?) 

 
Linking sentences 
Conjunctions are words used to link sentences together, but it is not always a good 
idea to have long sentences when you are giving instructions. There are other ways to 
create a link between sentences, without joining them. 
 
Connecting words help link or join ideas in a paragraph so that a piece of 
writing flows. Connecting words are often used at the beginning of a sentence, e.g. 
however. A comma must be inserted when the connecting word is used at the 
beginning of a sentence.  
 
 
Another way of linking sentences is to use pronouns 
so that you don’t have to say the same Proper or 
Common noun over and over again.  

 
Finite verbs and Clauses 
Finite verbs have a subject and can stand alone.  
E.g. Jack is tall. Jilly runs fast. 
 
A clause is a group of words that contain a 
finite verb and a subject. If it makes sense on 
its own, it is called an independent or main 
clause.  
E.g. Jilly and Diana are sailing after Jack. 

Activity 8: Rewrite the following sentences into your workbook. Underline the subject
and circle the finite verbs.
1. Jolly Jack looks for treasure.
2. Trevor the Terrible buried his treasure on the island.
3. The pirates clean their ship.
4. Tough Tshepo hopes to be a pirate.
 
Complex sentences 
A complex sentence has one main clause and one or 
more subordinate clauses. A subordinate clause adds 
extra information to the main clause and cannot stand by 
itself. Subordinate clauses are joined to the main clause 
by linking words, e.g. that, which, although, unless, while. 
For example, Jack fed the parrot that is always hungry. 

Here’s a hint: to find a 
finite verb, find the verb 
and then ask “who” or 
“what”. This will give you 
the subject.  

Activity 10:
Underline the main clause, circle the conjunctions and highlight the subordinate
(supporting) clauses in the sentences below.
1. They found the treasure after searching all over the island.
2. Jolly Jack found the treasure before anyone else could dig it up.
3. Sand blew into the hole while the pirates were resting.

Abbreviations 
An abbreviation is a shortened form of a word or a phrase. 
Types of abbreviations: 
• The initials of the words are used (Republic of South 
Africa – RSA) – This is called Initialism. 
• Truncation is when the word is shortened ( January – Jan. ) a full stop is used if the 
last letter of the abbreviation is not the same as the last letter of the origional word. 

Acronym 
 An acronym is a special abbreviation 
when the initials make a “word”:  
HIV/AIDS – HIV is an abbreviation (letters 
are said individually) 
 AIDS is an acronym (it makes another 
“word”) 
One of Trevor the Terrible’s men has stolen 
a sack of letters and left the abbreviations 
behind.  

Activity 12: Write down the abbreviations in your book and then write out the full
words.
1. Ave -
2. Dr -
3. km -
4. no. -
5. mm -
6. www -
7. Nov. -
8. e.g. -

Activity 13: Write down 5 examples of acronyms.
1. ___________________ 3. ___________________
2. ___________________ 4. ___________________
 
Theme 2

Future Continuous Tense 
Tenses show when an action takes place: past, present or future. The future tense 
shows that the action is about to happen. The continuous form of the future tense 
shows that the action will be ongoing.  
E.g. I shall/will be taking you to school next week.  
Add the word: be 
The verb changes and the participle gets “-ing” on the end. 

Activity 14: Write the sentences down and then change them into the future continuous
tense.
1. Jolly Jack finds lots of treasure.
2. He sails across the Atlantic Ocean.
3. Jolly Jack sings in bad weather.
4. My friend hides from Trevor the Terrible.
5. Trevor theTerrible kills and takes all the other treasure from the other pirates
 
Present Continuous Tense 
The present tense shows that the action takes place now or today. The continuous 
form of the tense shows that the action is ongoing.  
E.g. I am singing a song.  
You can also use: is or are  
The verb changes and usually gets “-ing” 

Activity 15: Write the sentences down and then change them into the present
continuous tense.
1. Jolly Jack searched for the golden cup on Treasure Island.
2. I saw Trevor the Terrible steal the prize possession.
3. Trevor the Terrible sips rum from the golden cup.
4. Jolly Jack tries to get it back.
5. Trevor’s men sail with the golden cup.
 
Past Continuous Tense 
The past tense shows that the action has already happened. The continuous form of 
the past tense shows that the action was ongoing.  
E.g. I was taking you to school last week.  
You can also use: were 
The verb changes and the participle gets “-ing” on the end. 

Activity 16: Write the sentences down and then change them into the past continuous
tense.
1. Jolly Jack writes a letter to his mom.
2. A crew member breaks the mop.
3. The mops falls into Jolly Jack’s path.
4. Jolly Jack screams.
5. The crew members walk the plank. 

Active and Passive Voice
 
Verbs can be used in two ways: 
• If the subject is doing the action, the verb is said to be active. 
• If the subject has the action done to it, the verb is said to be passive. 
We usually use the active voice in narrative writing because It is shorter, easier and 
more direct. 
• the tense of the verb must be changed when yu convert to passive voice 
 
Active voice:  The cartoonist drew the characters.        
Passive voice: The characters were drawn by the cartoonist. 

Activity 17: Convert the sentences below to the passive voice.
1. I am writing a letter.
2. Every day my brother made a fire.
3. My brother saw a tiger

Theme 4 

Singular and Plural 
Singular is a word showing that there is only one. 
Plural is a word used to show more than one. 
          
Usually, to show a plural of a noun, you add an ‘s’.  
         singular            plural 
 
E.g. daughter – daughters 
 
 
 
Telling tales 
 
 
A question is a type of sentence that is used to find 
out things. We ask questions to find out what things 
mean, how people feel, what we need to do, etc. 
Questions start with a capital letter, and end with a 
question mark. 

The setting of a story 
is the place where 
the story takes place. 

 
The Fisherman and the Genie 
 
Once there was a fisherman who was old and poor that he 
could hardly support his wife and three children. Every day, 
he got up early and went to throw his net into the sea. 
One day he pulled out his net and found an enormous, 
antique jar made of flame-red copper. The fisherman was delighted, thinking he could sell it in 
the market. But first he thought he should open it to find out if there was anything of value 
inside.
 
The lid was so tightly sealed that he had to work hard to free it. As he did, a cloud of foul-
smelling smoke burst from the jar and billowed up into the air. The fisherman realised that this 
was a spell and tried to replace the lid – but it was too late. As he cowered beneath the 
smoke, it swirled into strange patterns before finally settling into the unmistakable shape of a 
genie.  
The fisherman guessed that this genie was a dangerous, evil 
creature. It seemed as tall as the sky, with eyes like burning coals 
and hands like claws. Its mouth was as big as a cave and gaped 
open in a nasty grin. 
“Listen!” it roared. “I bring you important news!” 
“What news is that?” asked the poor fisherman, trembling. 
The genie bent down close to the fisherman and burped up a 
pungent smell of camel dung before replying, “Today you are going 
to die, you creeping, boneless, maggot of a man!” 
 
“But what… what… have I done?” stammered the fisherman. 
“You freed me too late!” roared the genie. “If you had let me out a thousand years ago, I 
would have showered you with riches. But no, you left me in that prison for so long that now I 
am going to take my revenge by torturing you to death.” 
 
 
 
Questions: 
a. What is the setting of this story? Give reasons. 
What clues are there in the story? 
b. Clues are words in the text that tell us the sort of place the story takes place in. List what 
clues you would expect to find if a story was set in these places: beside the sea, in the 
mountains, in the desert. 
c. The writer has used interesting words to bring the setting and story to life. Make a list of 
these words and discuss how they add to the effect of the story. 

 
 
Direct Speech 

Using their words 
Did you notice that the storyteller in The Fisherman and the Genie uses the exact words said 
by the characters? 
Learn about direct speech 
In the pictures below we know who says what because the words are in a speech bubble 
coming from the characters mouth. When we write, we use punctuation to show what the 
person has said. Instead of a speech bubble, we use inverted commas (quotation marks) on 
either side of the words that are spoken, like this: “…” 

 
The fisherman did not give up. He searched his mind for an idea, before saying hoarsely, “Sir, 
I don’t believe you.” 
“You don’t believe me?” roared the genie, astonished. 
“You could never have been stuck inside that jar. You’re far too mighty and big – it’s 
impossible.” 
“You dare to call me a liar?” bellowed the genie. 
“I do, Sir,” whispered the fisherman. 
“Of course I was in the jar!” the genie thundered. “You saw me!” 
 
 
“The smoke was too thick,” said the fisherman, “I couldn’t see through it.” 
The genie turned purple with rage and began to spin round in a dizzy dance.  
“I shall prove to you, maggot man, just how easily I can fit myself back into that jar. And as 
soon as I have, I shall leap out and tear you into tiny pieces.” 
Round and round he whirled shrinking back down into the dark, hollow jar.  
“Now I’m coming out to get you!” he called. 
But the fisherman leapt forward, snatched the lid, rammed it in place tightly that no power on 
Earth could have forced it off, and flung the jar far out into the sea. 
 
 
 
 
Activity 27: Answer the questions that follow. 
a. What information does the story give about the fisherman’s character? 
b. Choose b adjectives to describe his character.  
c. The writer describes the genie’s eyes, hands and mouth by comparing them to other 
things. What are they? 
d. Why was the genie so angry? 
e. Do you think the fisherman did the right thing in the end? 
f. What feeling is the writer trying to create once the genie is let out of the jar? 
g. Give one word with a prefix from the last paragraph of the story. 
h. Find one word with a suffix from the last paragraph of the story. 



• A good story has a strong 
plot: it must be interesting 
and it must make sense. 
• A good story starts by 
immediately catching the 
reader’s attention, so that 
the reader wants to read on 
to find out what happens. 
• A 
good 
story 
has 
as 
interesting and satisfying 
ending. 

 
Indirect (Reported) Speech. 

Remember that direct speech shows us the person’s exact words.  
E.g. “I don’t believe you,” said the fisherman. 
 
Indirect (reported) speech is a different way of showing what someone said and 
doesn’t give the exact words. Add the word “that” and change the tense and pronoun. 
E.g. The fisherman said that he didn’t believe the genie. 
 
Activity 28: Rewrite the following sentences using indirect (reported) speech. 
a. “I will teach you a lesson,” shouted the genie. 
b. “You couldn’t have been stuck inside that jar,’ said the fisherman. 
c. “I was in the jar!” the genie thundered.  
d. “I’m coming out to get you!” he called. 
e. “The smoke was too thick,” said the fisherman. 
 
 
 
 
 
Direct objects 

Remember, some sentences have an object. The object is 
part of the predicate.  
A direct object is the person or thing that receives the 
action by the subject and the verb.  
E.g. The fisherman opened the jar. 
       The jar contained the genie. 
       The genie threatened the fisherman. 
 
 
 
 
Activity 29: Rewrite the paragraph by filling in the direct objects.

The fisherman found a magic __________. He opened the __________ and let out the evil
__________. The fisherman tricked the __________. The fisherman caught some rainbowcoloured __________. The sultan gave some gold __________ to the fisherman as a reward.
Activity 30: Rewrite the following sentences and underline the direct object.
1. One day he pulled out his net.
2. The genie bent down close to the fisherman and burped up a pungent smell.
3. The fisherman freed the genie too late.
4. The genie will leap up and tear the fisherman into tiny pieces
5. The fisherman snatched the lid and rammed it into place.
