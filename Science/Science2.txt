Welcome to Grade e and 
to Natural Sciences and 
Technology! 
Join the 
Thunderbolt Kids 
on an adventure to explore the 
world around us.
Hi there! My name is Farrah.
My favourite subjects at school are where I 
get to be creative and imaginative. But, did 
you know, this is not only in the art or drama 
classroom?! We can also be creative in the ways 
we do Science and Technology. This is especially 
true when thinking about new ways to answer a 
question with a Science investigation or drawing 
a design to solve a problem.
I also really love being outdoors in the natural 
world around me. This is why I am going to go 
through Life and Living and Structures with 
you. I think we are very lucky to live in such a 
beautiful place as South Africa, with so many 
colours and plants and animals. I am really 
excited to start learning more about the living 
world around us. 
Sophie is my best friend and she teaches me 
how to think carefully and solve problems 
using logic, which is a very good skill to have in 
Science. Although we can get on each other’s 
nerves, just like best friends do, we have so much 
fun together and learn a lot from each other.
Hey! My name is Tom.
I have two places where I am most happy! The 
ﬁ rst is in the Science lab because this is where 
we get to be inventive and tinker away with 
projects and experiments! My second favourite 
place is the junk yard! Do you know how many 
interesting objects you can ﬁ nd there?! I use 
these objects in my latest inventions.
This is why I am really excited to be going 
through Matter and Materials and Processing 
with you. This year we are going to learn more 
about materials, especially metals. And we will 
get to see how to make new materials. I ﬁ nd 
this really interesting, especially to see how 
these methods have evolved over time.
I also really enjoy maths and thinking about 
how we can solve problems logically. Jojo is 
one of my best mates, although he can be 
very messy at times! But, Jojo helps me get 
involved with my whole body when trying to 
solve problems in our daily lives, and not just 
use my mind.

What’s up! My name is Jojo.
I just want to dive straight into this year, and 
especially Natural Sciences and Technology. 
Sometimes though, I ﬁ nd it hard to sit still in 
class as I just want to get up and do things! My 
teacher often says I have too much energy and 
I battle to sit still in class. Maybe that’s why 
I am going through Energy and Change and 
Systems and Control with you this year. 
I am really looking forward to understanding 
more about what “energy” really is! And, 
this year we start to learn about electricity. 
The best part about Natural Sciences and 
Technology for me is that we get to learn 
actively. We have goals and questions which 
we want to answer and I am always the ﬁ rst to 
leap into action!
Tom and I make a very good team because 
he is very good at thinking and planning and 
then following a method. But, I think I can also 
help as sometimes Tom wants to think too 
much, whereas in Science and Technology you 
also have to get involved in the subject and 
start experimenting.
Hello! My name is Sophie.
One of my favourite places to be is in the school 
library. I love reading a new book – there is just 
so much to learn and discover about our world!
I am always asking questions and often these 
questions do not yet have answers to them. To 
me, this is fascinating as we then get to make a 
theory about what we think the answer might 
be. This is why I really enjoy learning about 
outer Space as there is so much that we do not 
know. Throughout history people have been 
asking questions about Space and our place 
in the universe. This is why I am going to go 
through Earth and Beyond and Systems and 
Control with you. This year we will look more 
at our planet Earth and I am really interested to 
ﬁ nd out more about fossils.
I also like expressing my opinion and debating 
about a topic. You have to give me a very good 
argument to convince me of your opinion! I 
love exploring with Farrah as she helps me to 
be more creative and imaginative in the way 
that I think. I can also be quite sceptical and do 
not believe everything I read. But, this is very 
important in Science as we must not always 
accept everything as fact.

• What's the coldest place where animals live?
• gow deep is the sea and are there animals and plants down
there?
• Where is the highest mountain on earth? Do you get plants
and animals that live up there?
• Do you get living things in a desert?
• What are vertebrates and invertebrates?
You might have heard that people say our planet darth is the blue
Planet. When astronauts in space look down on darth, the water
that covers more than two thirds of the planet makes it look as if
the planet is blue. Thousands of plants and animals can live on
darth because there is water.
The many plants and animals that live on earth choose special
places to live. The place where a plant or animal lives is called its
habitat.
There is a special word we use when talkinh about all the animals
and plants and their diﬀerent habitat. We call it 'biodiversity' When
you look at the biodiversity of a certain area you look at all the
diﬀerent kinds of habitats in that area including all the animals and
plants in that area.
..
DID YOU KNOW?
Plants and animals
need water to live.
Scientists search for
water on other
planets because they
hope that if they ﬁnd
water they might ﬁnd
life forms there as
well!
.
QUdSThONS
.Discuss this in class:
Why is it important to study the
biodiversity of our planet?
Write down some of the main
points from your class discussion below.
 . 
Many diﬀerent plants and animals
The darth is home to the most amazing diversity of animals and
plants. dach animal and plant naturally chooses where it wants to
live: its habitat.
We can identify diﬀerent types of habitats on earth, such as:
..
New Words
• adapted
• extinct
• classify
• indigenous
• biome
.
• aquatic (water)
• Desert
• frassland
• eorest
Within each habitat there are animals and plants that have adapted
to live speciﬁcally in that environment. Let's take a look at some of
the most common plants and animals that live in each of these
diﬀerent kinds of habitats.
Let's now take a closer look at the diﬀerent habitats in South
africa and some of the plants and animals that we ﬁnd there.
aquatic habitats
Thousands of diﬀerent animals and plants live in or near water in
aquatic habitats. There are two main kinds of aquatic habitats -
marine (saltwater) habitats and freshwater habitats. The plants
and animals that live in these habitats are adapted to either live in
salt water or in fresh water.
hn South africa there are examples of both types of aquatic
habitats.
..
DID YOU KNOW?
"aqua" means "water"
in Latin. a word with
"aqua" in it normally
has something to do
with water - like
aquatic or aquarium.
.
Our country has a very long coastline with many diﬀerent types of
habitats. eor example, many animals live in and around the rock
pools. They have to withstand the harsh sun and the constant
pounding of the waves.

Life and Living
The sea is also home to many species of ﬁsh. a group of ﬁsh is
called a school of ﬁsh. The coral reefs oﬀ the South african coast,
especially on the dast coast such as Sodwana bay, are very rich in
ﬁsh and animal species.
..
DID YOU KNOW?
The waters oﬀ South
africa's coast is home
to a rare ﬁsh - the
coelacanth! Scientists
thought this
prehistoric ﬁsh was
extinct until they
found living
coelacanths in South
africa's waters!
.
Where a river runs into the sea, a special area called an estuary
develops. The fresh water from the river mixes with the salty sea
water. You can often ﬁnd mudskippers here (ﬁsh that can hop onto
land and into trees!)
Mudskippers live in estuaries, but they can hop onto land and into low
branches!

Plants and animals on darth
.
 . Many eco-tourists like to visit our country and see the natural
sights and attractions. Some tourists like to go on tours
where they enter into a cage which is lowered into the water.
The tour operators often chuck small pieces of meat into the
water to attract sharks which then swim around the cage.
This is called shark cage diving. Do you think shark cage
diving is appropriate? dxplain why you think so.
Now let's look at the plants and animals that live in freshwater,
such as dams, ponds, stream and rivers.
Many animals live in or near freshwater ponds, dams and lakes,
rivers and streams. These include small insects, snails, clams, crabs,
frogs and ﬁsh. Larger animals like turtles, snakes, ducks and large
ﬁsh, as well as hippos and crocodiles also live in or near water.
..

Sharks have amazing
hearing. They can
hear a ﬁsh moving in

hn South africa we also have large wetlands where rivers slow
down and the water stands still or ﬂows very slowly. Wetlands
provide food and shelter and a natural habitat for an incredible
amount of animals: frogs, reptiles, birds (like ducks and waders)
and ﬁsh, to name a few!
..
.acThVhTY: Studying an aquatic habitat

MaTdRhaLS:
• pencil

hNSTRUcThONS:
 . Visit an aquatic habitat near your school; a stream or river,
pond or dam, or perhaps a rockpool if you are near the sea.
 . eind examples of   diﬀerent animals and   diﬀerent plants
that live in that environment.
 . carefully study where they live and how you think the animals
and plants are suited to their habitat. answer questions such
as:
a) are the stems of the plants rigid or ﬂexible?
b) Do the plants grow inside the water or just outside?
c) What do the animals eat?
d) gow do the animals breathe?
 . hf possible, take some pictures of the plants and animals you
observe.
 . Report this information back to your class.
Deserts and semi-desert habitat
Deserts are areas that have a very low rainfall each year - in some
deserts it only rains once every    years!
..
  
.
Life and Living
The Namibian desert.
The desert may look dry, but there are many diﬀerent plants and
animals which are suited to living in these areas. Plants that can
survive without much water in the desert include grasses, acacias,
aloes, cactii and other succulents. Succulents are plants that can
store their water in their leaves and stems and survive well in dry
climates.
can you see how thick the leaves of this succulent plant are? The leaves
are where the plant stores water.
Many animals live in the desert (for example, the Kalahari),
including:
• Predators (eg. lions, cheetahs and leopards, hyenas, jackals)
• Large and small mammals (eg. meerkats, giraﬀes, warthogs,
porcupines)
• antelope (eg. eland, gemsbok, springbok and hartebeest,
steenbok, kudu,duiker)

Life and Living
frassland habitat
frasslands are covered in grasses with very few trees. as soon as
the ﬁrst rains fall the grasses grow incredibly fast and new plants
sprout all over the bare earth. This is also the time when many
animal babies are born as the new grass can feed the mothers to
provide plenty of milk for the young.
QUdSThONS
.List some of the animals which you think live in grasslands.
eorest habitat
a forest is a large area that is mostly covered in trees. eorests are
extremely important to life on earth. The many trees clean the air
and provide oxygen for the animals on earth to breathe. They also
provide people with fuel, food and shelter, medicine and
employment (through all the industries that are built around
forestry). Many animals live in forests, from large elephants and
bears to smaller monkeys, squirrels, owls and woodpeckers.
We need to conserve (look after) our forests and stop people who
want to chop down naturally growing trees. ht is very important to
also conserve the many animals that help pollinate trees and
spread their seeds over large areas. Without these animals the
trees would not be able to reproduce and would become extinct.

• depend
• ecosystem
• pollinator
• water vapour
• atmosphere
.
Plants and animals, humans, rivers, mountains - everything is
connected in one way or another. all living and non-living things
depend on each other.
We can group interdependence into two main groups:
 . The interdependence in an ecosystem between living things
(how animals and plants are interdependent).
 . The interdependence in an ecosystem between living and
non-living things.
hnterdependence between living things
Many plants and animals depend on each other for diﬀerent things.
Let's have a look at some of these:
 ) hnterdependence and feeding
animals depend on plants and other animals for food. animals can
be divided into the following groups, according to what they eat:
• gerbivores eat plants.
• carnivores eat the animals that eat the plants.
• Omnivores eat plants and animals.
• Scavengers feed oﬀ plants and dead animals.
• Decomposers are animals that assist the natural process of
decomposition. They eat and break down the remains of dead
animals. The elements that are released during this process
(carbon, phosphorus and nitrogen) are put back in the soil
and become food for plants.
..
DID YOU KNOW?
an ecosystem is a
community of living
things that depend
on, and interact with,
each other and the
non-living things
(water, air and soil) in
their diﬀerent
habitats.
.
 ) hnterdependence and pollination
Plants depend on animals for pollination.
animals that pollinate ﬂowers are called pollinators. Plants use
diﬀerent methods to attract pollinators. This includes producing
nectar, special smells or having brightly coloured ﬂowers. Some
plants even make their ﬂowers look like female wasps to attract
male wasps!
..
  
.
Life and Living
bees about to collect nectar and, at the same time, pollinate the ﬂowers.
  
..
DID YOU KNOW?
Pollinate means the
pollen from one
ﬂower needs to get to
the pollen from
another ﬂower to
pollinate it.
.
Plants and animals depend on each other. Many ﬂowering plants
depend on bees to pollinate them. bees depend on ﬂowers to
provide them with nectar. Without nectar, bees cannot make
honey. Without bees, most ﬂowers cannot be fertilised. hf ﬂowers
are not fertilised, they cannot produce seeds and will not be able
to reproduce.
..
DID YOU KNOW?
Sometimes farmers
don't have enough
bees on their farms to
pollinate their crops.
They "rent a hive"
from travelling bee
hive managers who
bring their hives to
pollinate the farmer's
crops.

DID YOU KNOW?
 /  of everything we
eat is there thanks to
pollinators! We really
depend on pollinators
for our food!
.
a world without pollinators would not be very sweet. Look at the
following things we eat and drink that all depend on pollinators.
..
  
.
Life and Living
Without pollinators, we would not
have blackberries and raspberries
to eat.   
Strawberries are delicious! The
fruits are produced once the
ﬂowers on the strawberry plants
have been pollinated.   
  Diﬀerent types of nuts form after
pollination.
Red and green apples are the fruits
produced on apple trees after
pollinators have pollinated the
ﬂowers.   
 ) hnterdependence and seed dispersal
Plants need to have their seeds spread over a wide area. hf all the
seeds fall in one spot, the plants that grow will not have enough
water, soil or sunlight to grow properly! That is why plants make
their fruit sweet and tasty. hn this way they attract animals who will
eat the fruit, walk a long way oﬀ and excrete the seeds. Where the
seeds fall they will then have a rich, fertile soil (from the animal

animals.
hNSTRUcThONS:
 . Read the story about the honey badger and the honey guide
below
 . answer the questions which follow.
The honey badger loves to eat honey! The honeyguide bird loves
to eat the bee larvae, but cannot get into the beehive without
being stung to death. The bird also cannot break the hive open. So
when the honeyguide ﬁnds a beehive, it goes in search of a honey
badger. The honey badger has a thick skin that is resistant to bee
stings.

The honey guide convinces the honey badger to follow it to the
bee hive. The honey badger is able to use its strong legs and claws
and teeth to break open the hive while its thick coat protects it
from being stung. after the badger has ﬁnished eating the
delicious golden honey, the honeyguide can enjoy all the bee
larvae!
The honey badger follows the honey guide bird.

Description of
interdependence
a: clownﬁsh and anemones.
clownﬁsh are not hurt by the
poison from the anemone. The
clownﬁsh feed on small
creatures living in the anemone.
These creatures can harm the
anemone. Not only does the
clownﬁsh remove these
creatures, but the anemone
uses its waste for nourishment.
The anemone's poisonous
stings protects the clown ﬁsh
from predators.
b: darthworms in soil.
darthworms are dependent on
the soil for a place to live. hf the
earthworm is exposed to air for
too long, its skin will dry out.
That is why they need rich,
moist soil to live in. as
earthworms dig through the soil
they also excrete droppings
back into the soil which makes
it more fertile for other plants
and animals. Their digging
helps to aerate the soil by
creating tunnels.
c: Weaver bird building its nest.
Many birds need trees and
plants to build their nests in so
they can raise their young. The
weaver uses young, green reeds
to build its nest. These reeds
are ﬂexible and bend easily.
When they dry out, they
become harder and make a
stable, stronger nest.

D: Rhino and oxpecker. The
oxpecker eats the ticks that are
on the rhino's skin. The
oxpecked feeds on these ticks
and the rhino is freed from the
pests. Oxpeckers have the same
relationship with zebra, giraﬀe,
buﬀalo, etc.
d: anatolian Shepherds and the
herd of sheep they are
protecting from predators.
anatolian puppies are placed
with a ﬂock of sheep at an early
age. They become attached to
the ﬂock. When a predator (like
a cheetah) comes near the
ﬂock, the anatolian Shepherd
dogs will chase the predator oﬀ.
When a ﬂock is protected by an
anatolian Shepherd, the
predators (for example,
cheetahs) are also indirectly
protected, because the farmers
will not need to kill them in
order to protect their sheep.

frouping animals
When we group similar things together, it is called classifying.
When classifying animals, there are generally two main groups of
animals - those who have bones inside their bodies with a
backbone, and those who do not have bones inside their bodies.

Vertebrates
Vertebrates are animals that have a skeleton inside their bodies (an
endoskeleton). Part of their skeleton is a backbone. The word
'vertebrate' is closely related to the word 'vertebrae' which is what
we call the individual bones that form the backbone (so
vertebrates have a backbone made up of vertebrae). Vertebrates
are broken down into   smaller groups:
• eish
• amphibians (including frogs)
• Reptiles
• birds
• Mammals

vertebrae are connected, the holes all line up to form a tube.
This is where you ﬁnd the spinal cord. The spinal cord is a
bundle of nerves that is connected to the brain. ht is

opposite muscle relaxes.
To bend your arm, the bicep muscle "contracts" and pulls on the
radius bone. The tricep muscle relaxes, allowing your arm to bend
at the elbow joint.
To straighten your arm, the tricep muscle contracts and pulls on
the ulna bone while your bicep muscle relaxes and your arm

• gow does a skeleton or shell keep things safe inside?
• Do humans have shell or frame structures?
• gow do you make a structure really strong?
hn this chapter we will investigate two kinds of structures, frame
and shell structures.
 . 
Structures
a structure is something that is arranged or put together in a
speciﬁc way and is made up of diﬀerent parts. a jungle gym is an
example of a structure. ht has many diﬀerent parts like beams,
ropes, and bars, that are put together in a special way.
a jungle gym is a type of structure. , 
Most structures are designed to remain stable and rigid which
means they should not break and crumble or topple and fall over if
something heavy is placed on top of or against them.
..
New Words
• frame structure
• shell structure
• support
• weight
• enclose
• resist
• load
.
Structures have diﬀerent jobs or functions. They:
• support
• protect
• enclose - that means they keep something in or they keep
things from getting in (like a tin of juice or a fence around a
building).
• help with movement
We get three kinds of structures:
• frame structures
• shell structures
• solid structures
hn all structures, the shape of the structure is very important. a
structure will be able to resist or hold a certain weight depending
on its shape.
hn fr.   in Matter and Materials, we looked at strong frame
structures and also how to make structures stronger using struts
and braces. hn this chapter in Life and Living, we are going to focus
on two kinds of structures: frame structures and shell structures.
This is because they relate to the skeletons of animals.
QUdSThONS
.Turn to a friend and think about the words "Shell Structure"
and "erame Structure" and think what these could mean. Then
think of examples of frame structures and of shell structures
that you can see in buildings or perhaps on your walk or ride
to school. Report back and discuss these with your class.
erame structures
erame structures are easy to identify because they have a frame or
a skeleton. These structures are built or put together by attaching
pieces of material together to make a frame. Look at these photos
of frame structures.

.Turn to a friend and discuss what you think all these structures
have in common - what is the same? Report back to your class.
One of the most important
frame structures for all
vertebrate animals is their
skeleton. The material used to
make this frame is bone that
is attached to the muscles
that move the skeleton. The
skeleton supports the
muscles and protects the
organs.

rib cage. can you see how it
makes a frame structure?
The rib cage is a frame structure.

Skeletons as structures
QUdSThONS
.Which organs does the rib cage protect?
hn general, we can say that all vertebrates have a frame structure as
a skeleton. This is because vertebrates have an endoskeleton
which supports makes a frame to support the body.
Shell structures
Shell structures generally hold or protect things inside the
structure. gumans make shell structures to protect and hold
things, like a dish, a tin, a car or house.
a car has shell structure which protects the passengers inside.  
These guavas are contained in a basket which is a shell structure.  
hn nature, eggshells and the exoskeletons of invertebrates, like crab
and crayﬁsh shells, are examples of shell structures. Shell
structures are made to resist a very heavy load.

Strengthening Structures
Structures that protect something or hold a weight without
breaking or falling, need to be really strong. Let's investigate the
diﬀerent ways we can use to strengthen a structure.
Do you remember in fr.   Matter and Materials when we looked at
whether a triangle or a square was stronger? Look at the picture to
remind yourself.

is the most stable and rigid? dxplain how you could make the
other shape stronger and more stable.
corners in structures are very important because it is often the
weakest point of a structure. To strengthen corners you can:
• Put another support (called a brace) across a rectangle's
corner to make a triangle. This makes the corner much
stronger.

eood and feeding in plants and animals
Let's read the following story together.
Who is the most important?
Some animals stood on the soft green grass around the waterhole
one day, admiring the ﬁne job that the maker had done!
The tortoise, slowly and carefully said: "Of all creation h think h like
the ﬂamingos the best! Their beautiful pink and white feathers,
their graceful necks and long legs - they're just amazing! They are
so beautiful maybe they're the most important."

Warthog just harrumphed and rolled in the squishy brown mud
munching on some roots.
"Those ﬂamingos are far too delicate!" said the springbok "Look at
that strong, fearsome buﬀalo - no one ever messes with him! gis
horns are so sharp he can pierce a rock! h think he is the most
important in all creation!"
Warthog just harrumphed and sat on the cool green grass taking a
huge tasty mouthful.
The baboon jumped from his perch in a nearby tree "gahaha-ing"
and "KwahKwahKwah-ing" as he went. "You are all so wrong! Look
at the eagle - she soars over everyone and can see everything. She
is always safe high in the cliﬀs and never has to come to this messy
old waterhole. She doesn't need us - she is the most important of
everyone!"
Warthog just harrumphed and scratched his back against the
rough hard bark of a baobab.
The dungbeetle clambered on top of his ball, rested his head on his
hand and said: "You have no idea - the ants, now they're an
important bunch! Without those little fellows the entire world
would be covered in dead stuﬀ! The smell would be
un-be-lie-va-ble! They are the most important by far!"
Warthog harrumphed, really loudly this time. "Without plants we'd
all be gone!" and with that he shoved a clump of reeds and
munched at the little insects escaping.
Do you think plants get hungry? hf they do not have mouths, how
do they eat?

Plants make their own

PLants do not daT in the same way humans do. They make their
own food inside their little "factories". They do this through a
process called photosynthesis:
• They absorb water and nutrients through their roots.
• The water travels to the leaf or stem where the plants make
the food
• The plants also carbon dioxide (a gas) from the air.
• They also use energy from the sun (which they get from the
sunlight) for this process
• The plants use the water and carbon dioxide gas with the
sunlight energy to make food in the form of sugars.

• Oxygen (a gas) is given oﬀ as a by-product of this process.
• The plant can then use the food (sugars) that it produced to
carry out its own life processes.
• Plants generally make much more food than they need to live.
They store the extra food that they make in diﬀerent parts of
the plant.
• animals then eat these parts of the plant (or the whole plant).
Plants make their own food through the process of photosynthesis.

The sun is a source of energy for all living things on earth.  
at the beginning of this term you learnt that animals and plants are
interdependent - that means they depend on each other to survive.
all living plants and animals need food to give them energy in

plant uses during the process of photosynthesis and what the
plants make or produce from this. Write your answer below.
animals can't use sunlight, water and carbon dioxide to make food
like plants do. animals need to eat plants (or other animals) for
energy to carry out their life processes. Living things that get their
energy by eating either a plant or an animals are called consumers.
• Many animals get their energy from eating plants. We call
these animals herbivores.
• Some animals eat other animals to get energy. We call these
animals carnivores.
• Other animals can eat plants and animals, like baboons or
people. We call these animals omnivores.
• We get special animals called scavengers and decomposers.
They eat dead animals and break their bodies into tiny tiny
pieces that can go into the soil as compost. These pieces
must be small enough for plants to absorb.

There is a feeding relationship between producers and consumers.
We call this relationship a food chain.

• animals are the consumers.
a food chain describes how each living thing gets food and how
energy is passed from one organism to the next.
• When we draw a food chain we use an arrow (→) between
organisms to show that one eats the other and that energy is
transferred from the one organism to the next.

Stages in an animal life cycle
Most animals like ﬁsh, reptiles, birds and mammals have a simple
life cycle. We can identify diﬀerent stages in such a simple life
cycle:
• festation - before birth
• frowth and development
• Maturation
• Reproduction
..
New Words
• embryo
• gestation
• pregnancy
.
The gestation stage in an animal's life is the time before the
embryo (young animal) is bor animals produce young in diﬀerent
ways:
• born alive: some animals grow inside the womb of the
mother animal and are then born alive.
• gatched from eggs: the mother animal lays eggs and the
embryo develops inside the egg before it hatches.
• gatched from eggs inside the mother animal's body and are
then born alive: the embryo develops within an egg inside
the mother animal's body. The eggs can hatch just before or
just after birth.
festation - in a human the baby grows in the mother's womb and is then
born. hn a chicken, the mother lays an egg and the embryo develops in
the egg before hatching.

Life cycles
Once a young animal matures into an adult, it is ready to produce
its own oﬀspring. Mature females produce egg cells and mature
males produce sperm cells. When they mate, the male sperm cells
fertilise the female egg cells. This produces an embryo and the life
cycle begins all over again.
eertilisation is when a male sperm cell enters the female egg cell.
an animal can die at any stage in its life cycle. Various things can

• gow can we tell if something is made of a metal or a
non-metal?
• gow do we decide what material to use when we want to
make or build something?
hn this chapter we will learn about metals and non-metals. Do you
remember learning about materials in frade  . Metals and
non-metals are two diﬀerent classes of materials. dach class has its
own unique properties. Properties are the things that are special or
unique about an object or a material. We can use the properties of
a material to describe what it is like. eor example, we could say
that a property of a gas is that it can be compressed.
When we want to make a new product (a building or a tool or any
kind of object) we ﬁrst have to decide what the purpose of that
product will be. Perhaps we want to make a tool for digging in the
garden, or a kennel (dog house) for our new puppy. The purpose
of the product will help us decide which would be the best
material with which to make the object.
What would be the best material for a digging tool? Surely we
would need a tool that is strong and durable; with a sharp edge
that will allow us to cut through the soil when we dig into it.

 . What material would allow us to make a dog house that
is cool in summer and warm in winter?

building a house.

food question Tom! Let's look at the properties of metals. a
property is a word used to describe a material or object and tells
us something about it.
• Metals are usually shiny. The shine that we see when light
reﬂects oﬀ the surface of a metal is called the lustre of the
metal.
• Most metals are hard and they feel heavy.
• We say metals are dense as their particles are packed close
together.
• Metals conduct electricity and heat well. (You will learn more
about electricity next term. hn frade  , you will learn about
metals as conductors of electricity.)
• Metals are malleable (they can be shaped into ﬂat sheets) and
they are ductile (this means they can be made into thin wire)
• Most metals can be heated to high temperatures without
melting or changing their shape, which is one of the reasons
why pots and pans are made of metal. can you think of any
other reasons why pots and pans are made of metal?
• Metals are mined from the darth. You will learn more about
this in another subject, Social Sciences.
aaah! all these new words about metals! h still do not really know what
they all mean!
Do not worry Tom! These are new, big words, but here is an

New Words
• non-metal
• dull
• brittle
• insulator
.
Non-metals are materials that do not have the same properties as
metals.
• Non-metals are not shiny, but tend to be dull.
• Many non-metals are not bendy (ﬂexible) but brittle. This
means that they will break when we try to bend them with
enough force.
• Non-metals do not conduct electricity or heat well. We call
them insulators. can you think of a reason why pots and pans
often have plastic or wooden handles?
This kettle is made from metal and has a plastic handle.
hn the next activity we will investigate some of the properties of
non-metals. We will test and observe the non-metals in the same
way that we tested the metals in the previous activity. This is so
that we can compare metals and non-metals later on.

comparing metals and non-metals
What have we learnt about the properties of metals and
non-metals? Now we are ready to compare the properties of
metals and non-metals. Read through the two lists below. Do you
agree with the properties that have been listed? are there other
properties that you would like to add?
Metals are (mostly):
• solid and strong;
• malleable and ductile (this means they can be hammered or
bent into diﬀerent shapes);
• shiny or silvery (lustrous), especially when they are new; and
• cold to touch.
Non-metals:
• can be soft or ﬂexible, like rubber;
• can be hard and brittle, like glass;
• do not have a silvery (lustrous) appearance, but tend to be
dull;
• can be grouped into diﬀerent categories (ceramics, wood,
rubber, plastic, glass etc.); and
• usually feels neither cold nor hot.

 . Sometimes just using one property to classify an object or
material as a metal or non-metal might not be enough. eor
example, plastic is ﬂexible but strong, so does this make it a
metal? The answer is no. another example is glass. flass is
also hard, but is it strong? What other properties does glass
have which make it a non-metal and not a metal?

food inside a metal pot, and then we heat the outside of the pot.
This makes the food cook on the inside! gow does the heat get
inside the pot? The next activity will help us answer this question.

Metals and corrosion
gave you ever noticed how some metal objects are shiny when
they are new, but over time the shine disappears and they become
dull and blotchy? The car in the picture was once shiny and new,
but look at it now! ht is covered in rust from standing out in the rain

Uses of metals
an old car covered in rust.  
Rust has a reddish-brown colour and a rough texture. Rust is very
common; it is the product that forms when iron corrodes. During
corrosion, iron reacts with oxygen in the air or in water to form iron
oxide (the chemical name for rust). Rust is a type of corrosion, but
it is not the only type.
Other types of corrosion include:
• Tarnish (found on silver teapots, trays, trophies and jewellery)
• Patina (the green coating that we sometimes see on copper
objects)
• black spots that appear on brass.
• aluminium oxide (grey-white coating that forms on
aluminium)

dull and tarnished?

Uses of metals
Metals have thousands of uses. We use metals every day,
sometimes even without knowing!
Metals are ductile and good conductors of electricity. This is why
metal is used to make the wire inside electrical cables. Without
electrical cables we would not have electricity in our homes or
schools; we would not have lights or television, or telephones.
(Next term we will look more at electricity!)

When we combine materials, new materials are made. The
properties of the new materials are often diﬀerent from the
properties of the materials we started with.
There are many ways to process existing materials into new
materials. There are also many reasons why we would need to
process materials into new materials.
When we bake a cake, we are processing ﬂour, eggs and other
ingredients (that may not taste very nice on their own) into cake
which tastes really good!
We process materials to make them stronger, or more durable, or
waterproof, or even just to make them look more beautiful or
interesting. New materials that form after mixing diﬀerent
materials are sometimes called mixtures.

We have learnt that iron rusts over time, and that this process
speeds up when the iron is in contact with water. gave you ever
noticed rust on the knives and forks in your home? Probably not!
That is because they are not made of iron but of stainless steel.
but what is stainless steel?
..
.acThVhTY: a research project to learn about stainless
steel
Stainless steel is made by combining iron with other metals to
make it stronger and to prevent rust. Processing iron with other
metals to turn it into stainless steel means we can use it even in
wet environments. Water taps and pipes are sometimes made of
steel. Some of the instruments that doctors use to operate on sick
people are made of steel, and so are the pots and pans that we use
when we prepare food.

Often, when we mix materials together, the properties of the new
material or product is diﬀerent from the properties of the materials
we started with. Do you remember what the word "property"

Properties and uses
We call materials that have not yet been processed raw materials.
Raw materials are made into other things. When raw materials are
in the form in which they are found in nature, we can call them
natural materials. a natural material is any material that comes
from plants, animals, or the ground.
We have learnt that there are many diﬀerent ways in which
materials can be processed to give them new properties. after
processing they may look, smell, feel or taste diﬀerent. They will
probably also be used for a totally diﬀerent purpose from before.
Processed materials are materials which have been reﬁned or built
by humans from raw materials. Some examples include paper, steel
and glass.

People have been processing materials from the earliest times. hn
the old days only natural materials were available and people
found many clever ways to make these materials more useful.
The ﬁrst people who lived in our land had ways to harden wood
and bone for making tools and hunting weapons. They also had
ways of reinforcing the mud used for making traditional huts. They
knew which materials made the best clothes and blankets, and
which grass made the softest beds. They also knew exactly which
reeds would make the best mats to cover their walls, and how to
build houses best suited for their climate and lifestyle.
Some of these traditional ways of processing materials are still
used today. hn this section we will learn more about them.
..
.acThVhTY: Traditional materials and processing
before South africa was a country, several interesting groups of
people lived in our land. The Khoikhoi people were one of the ﬁrst
nations to live in Southern africa and many modern day
South-africans are descendants of the Khoikhoi. The Khoikhoi
were pastoral people who kept goats, but also hunted animals for
their meat and skins.
hNSTRUcThONS:
 . The following story tells us about the young Khoikhoi hunter,
geitsi, who prepares to go on an expedition to hunt a
springbok.
 . Read the story carefully, and look out for clues about the
ways in which geitsi's people used and processed materials.
..
   
.
Matter and Materials
.
 . When you have read the story, answer the questions that
follow.
geitsi prepares for the hunt
geitsi is getting his hunting kit ready for the hunt. ge is not a man
yet, but already a good hunter. When he was born,    summers
ago, his mother named him after geitsi-eibib, who was a mythical
hunter, sorcerer and warrior in the stories of his people. gis father
and uncles have taught him how to use the traditional hunting
weapons of the Khoikhoi: the bow and arrow and the "kierie"
(throwing stick).
geitsi is very excited about the hunt. Today he is hoping to kill a
springbok, because he wants to cut a head dress for himself from
the skin of the springbok. ge can already imagine how envious his
friends will be when he wears it proudly around his head.
ge will give the rest of the springbok skin to his mother to turn into
a blanket (karos) or a piece of clothing for his new baby sister. gis
mother will scrape the skin with a sharp stone or metal blade to
remove the hair and rub it with animal fat for a long time to make it
soft.
geitsi slings the quiver in
which he keeps his arrows
over his shoulder. The quiver
is made from tree bark. ht is a
good quiver, but he really
wants one made of animal
skin like the one his father
carries. The arrows inside the
quiver have wooden shafts
and sharp tips made of metal.
gis younger cousins have
arrows with tips made of
hardwood. hn the old days all
the arrow tips were made of
wood or bone, but geitsi's
people have been making
contact with other peoples
who have introduced them to
metal.
ge also keeps some tinder in his quiver. Tinder is the name for the
soft, dry plant materials his people use when starting a ﬁre.
another item he keeps in the quiver is a hollow reed that can be
used like a straw to suck up water that has collected on the leaves
of plants.
.
..
   
.
chapter  .
Processed materials
.
ge knows that he has to handle the arrow tips very carefully
because they are very sharp. ge keeps them sharp by rubbing
them on a special stone.
another reason why geitsi handles the arrows very carefully is
because their tips have been covered with a layer of poison. gis
cousins sometimes use the sap from poisonous plants to treat their
arrow tips, but he prefers to use snake poison because it is more
potent.
ge picks up his bow, and admires it for a moment. ge made it
himself from the ﬂexible wood of a wild olive tree. The bow string
is made from the gut of a small wild cat that he hunted last
summer. gis uncle's bow has a string made of twisted palm leaves,
and it makes a beautiful sound when Uncle holds the end of the
bow in his mouth and taps against the string with a stick. Tonight,
when they return from the hunt, the men will dance around the ﬁre
while the women sing and clap their hands. There will be stories
told about the hunt, and geitsi will honour the soul of the
springbok that he has killed.
The last weapon he picks up is his kierie. ht has a long handle and a
knob at the top end. The kierie was a gift from his favourite uncle.
Uncle made it himself from strong wood. To make the kierie even
stronger, Uncle placed it close to the ﬁre for a long time. The heat
from the ﬁre dried out the wood and made it tough and strong.
at last geitsi is ready for the hunt...
..
DID YOU KNOW?
eire-hardening is the
process of removing
moisture from wood
(or bone) by slowly
and lightly roasting it
over a ﬁre. This
process makes a point
(like that of a spear)
or an edge (like that
of a knife) stronger
and more durable.

Later, we will read about the traditional Khoikhoi house that geitsi
and his family lived in. eirst, we will learn about a diﬀerent kind of
traditional home, that is still seen today.
Some of the traditional homes in africa are made of clay or mud.
hn the activity Making bricks, we saw that mud (a mixture of soil
and water) is not a very strong material. When it is dry, it can
crumble and collapse. When it is reinforced, it can make a strong
and durable building material that can be used to build a house. hf
it is built well, the house will last for many years.

You may remember from the story geitsi prepares for the hunt,
that geitsi belongs to the Khoikhoi people from the days before
South africa was a country. hn those days there were no borders,
no provinces, no towns or cities, and no roads. No-one 'owned'
land; the land belonged to everyone who lived on it. hmagine that!
Like all the early people, the Khoikhoi had to make everything they
needed, because there were no shops then! They had to use
whatever materials were freely available.
The Khoikhoi people were nomads. That means they did not live in
one place for long. They moved their homes and their belongings
every few months, when the seasons changed. by moving around,
they could always live near good grazing. eresh green grass and
trees meant there would be leaf-eating animals around to hunt. h
..
   
.
Matter and Materials
also meant there would be good food around for themselves, and
for their goats to eat.
Read the story carefully for clues on which materials were used to
make a traditional Khoikhoi house.
geitsi moves house
geitsi's clan is on the move again. a few days ago, the clan packed
up all their belongings and started their long trek to the place that
will be their home for the summer months. The place where they
lived had become dry and dusty and it was becoming more and
more diﬃcult to ﬁnd good things to eat. They took apart their hut,
which they will rebuild when they reach their destination.
During the long trek, everyone has to help carry things. geitsi is
carrying his own sleeping mat and karos, and his hunting weapons.
ge also has to keep an eye on the goats in case they wander too
far from the clan.
after many days of walking, they arrived at the place that would be
their new home. Now they can rebuild their house.
The framework of the house must be strong so that the house will
stand ﬁrm. geitsi's mother and aunties have found some young
trees nearby and are cutting long, thin branches that will be
perfect for making a frame for the house. Once they have cut the
branches, they strip oﬀ the leaves.
The men bend the ﬂexible branches into crescent (half-moon)
shapes and tie them together with ﬂexible strips of tree bark. This
is how they build a dome-shaped framework for the house.
can you see the framework of tree branches? can you see what
the house is made of?
.

.
chapter  .
Processed materials
Women attaching the reed mats to the framework.
Once the framework is built, it is ready to be covered with reed
mats. eor this reason the house is called a matjieshuis (mat-house).
geitsi's mother and aunties made the mats by threading reeds
together with string that she made from the long thin leaves of
palm trees.
The whole family has to help with the ﬂoor of the house. They
bring clay from a nearby river and geitsi's mother makes the ﬂoor
by stomping down the wet clay with her feet. Once the clay has
dried, the ﬂoor will be smeared with animal manure. This is not as
disgusting as it sounds - the manure seals the clay to prevent it
from becoming sandy and dusty.
a ﬁre-hole will be dug in the middle of the ﬂoor, with sleeping
hollows (about    cm deep) around it. Soft plant material will be
placed in the sleeping hollows, and this will be covered with mats
and karosses to make comfortable beds for geitsi and his family.
geitsi loves his portable home. ht is the perfect shelter. hn hot, dry
weather, the openings between the reeds allow air to circulate
inside the house to keep it cool. ht also lets in light. ge knows that
when the rains come and the reed mats get wet, the reeds will
absorb water and swell out. Then they will seal tight and protect
the inside of the house against leaks. During the cold months, the
inside of the house will also be lined with animal skins to make it
extra warm and comfortable..

plant products, called plant ﬁbres. The people weave and stitch
the plant ﬁbres together to make diﬀerent objects, such as reed
mats, baskets, or even thatch to make a roof for a house. This is
