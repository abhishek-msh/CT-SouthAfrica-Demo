Welcome to Grade e and 
to Natural Sciences and 
Technology! 
Join the 
Thunderbolt Kids 
on an adventure to explore the 
world around us.
Hi there! My name is Farrah.
My favourite subjects at school are where I 
get to be creative and imaginative. But, did 
you know, this is not only in the art or drama 
classroom?! We can also be creative in the ways 
we do Science and Technology. This is especially 
true when thinking about new ways to answer a 
question with a Science investigation or drawing 
a design to solve a problem.
I also really love being outdoors in the natural 
world around me. This is why I am going to go 
through Life and Living and Structures with 
you. I think we are very lucky to live in such a 
beautiful place as South Africa, with so many 
colours and plants and animals. I am really 
excited to start learning more about the living 
world around us. 
Sophie is my best friend and she teaches me 
how to think carefully and solve problems 
using logic, which is a very good skill to have in 
Science. Although we can get on each other’s 
nerves, just like best friends do, we have so much 
fun together and learn a lot from each other.
Hey! My name is Tom.
I have two places where I am most happy! The 
ﬁ rst is in the Science lab because this is where 
we get to be inventive and tinker away with 
projects and experiments! My second favourite 
place is the junk yard! Do you know how many 
interesting objects you can ﬁ nd there?! I use 
these objects in my latest inventions.
This is why I am really excited to be going 
through Matter and Materials and Processing 
with you. This year we are going to learn more 
about materials, especially metals. And we will 
get to see how to make new materials. I ﬁ nd 
this really interesting, especially to see how 
these methods have evolved over time.
I also really enjoy maths and thinking about 
how we can solve problems logically. Jojo is 
one of my best mates, although he can be 
very messy at times! But, Jojo helps me get 
involved with my whole body when trying to 
solve problems in our daily lives, and not just 
use my mind.

What’s up! My name is Jojo.
I just want to dive straight into this year, and 
especially Natural Sciences and Technology. 
Sometimes though, I ﬁ nd it hard to sit still in 
class as I just want to get up and do things! My 
teacher often says I have too much energy and 
I battle to sit still in class. Maybe that’s why 
I am going through Energy and Change and 
Systems and Control with you this year. 
I am really looking forward to understanding 
more about what “energy” really is! And, 
this year we start to learn about electricity. 
The best part about Natural Sciences and 
Technology for me is that we get to learn 
actively. We have goals and questions which 
we want to answer and I am always the ﬁ rst to 
leap into action!
Tom and I make a very good team because 
he is very good at thinking and planning and 
then following a method. But, I think I can also 
help as sometimes Tom wants to think too 
much, whereas in Science and Technology you 
also have to get involved in the subject and 
start experimenting.
Hello! My name is Sophie.
One of my favourite places to be is in the school 
library. I love reading a new book – there is just 
so much to learn and discover about our world!
I am always asking questions and often these 
questions do not yet have answers to them. To 
me, this is fascinating as we then get to make a 
theory about what we think the answer might 
be. This is why I really enjoy learning about 
outer Space as there is so much that we do not 
know. Throughout history people have been 
asking questions about Space and our place 
in the universe. This is why I am going to go 
through Earth and Beyond and Systems and 
Control with you. This year we will look more 
at our planet Earth and I am really interested to 
ﬁ nd out more about fossils.
I also like expressing my opinion and debating 
about a topic. You have to give me a very good 
argument to convince me of your opinion! I 
love exploring with Farrah as she helps me to 
be more creative and imaginative in the way 
that I think. I can also be quite sceptical and do 
not believe everything I read. But, this is very 
important in Science as we must not always 
accept everything as fact.

This year we are going to learn about stored energy and how we
can use the stored energy to do something useful.

.
QUdSThONS
.What do you understand about the term fuel?
Discuss this
word with your partner and write down your own deﬁnition
below.
There are a few diﬀerent deﬁnitions for fuel. There are three main
categories that you can use to investigate fuels.
Some fuels can be burnt to create heat and light
Wood is often collected and burnt to give us heat and light. On a
cold evening, it is wonderful to sit around a ﬁre to tell stories and
warm yourself with friends.
This man has made a ﬁre to provide
heat and light. �
cooking meat on a ﬁre made from
wood in Khayelitsha. �
Wood comes from plants, speciﬁcally trees. Plants use light energy
from the Sun, as well as carbon dioxide and water to grow. Plants
take the energy and store it in their leaves, roots and all parts of
the plant. Wood also contains this energy stored by plants.
burning wood allows us to change this stored energy into light and
heat which is useful to us.
dnergy from the Sun is stored in the tree's wood which is released as light
and heat when we burn the wood.

Stored energy in fuels
coal is a type of fossil fuel
that is also burnt to provide
us with heat that we can use.
The heat from coal can be
used to cook our food and
warm our houses.
got coals burning
eossil fuels like coal were made from prehistoric plants. The plants
took up energy from the Sun and stored it in their bodies. Millions
of years ago, the darth was mostly covered by water. The plants
that died sank to the bottom of the water. Over millions of years,
the layers of plants were covered by layers of sand and
compressed by the weight of the sand. The plant material was
buried deeper and deeper under the ground where it is much
hotter than on the surface of the darth. Over millions of years, the
plant remains changed into fossil fuels.
..
VISIT
How fossil fuels are
made
goo.gl/rxiVG
.
These fuels get their name, "fossil fuels", because they are made
from plants and animals that lived a very long time ago.
Natural gas and oil are also examples of fossil fuels. Scientists have
realised that tiny sea organisms also died, sank to the the bottom
of the ocean, and were buried under the sand. Over millions of
years, many layers of dead sea animals got buried like this. Over
millions of years, the dead sea animals changed into oil and natural
gas.
Wax in a candle is burnt to provide light. by burning the candle,
the stored energy in the wax is released as light and heat energy.
candle wax is an everyday fuel that
we use to give us light.
a paraﬃn lamp �
Paraﬃn is also a fuel that contains stored energy. Paraﬃn is burnt
in paraﬃn lamps and paraﬃn stoves to provide us with useful
energy in the form of light and heat.
..

.
dnergy and change
fas is another fuel that can be burnt to release stored energy in
the form of heat and light. We can use gas heaters to keep warm,
and gas stoves to cook food and boil water. Natural gas is
odourless and colourless, and it is also known as 'clean gas'
because, unlike other fossil fuels, it doesn't produce harmful
byproducts when it burns.
eood is fuel for the body
gumans and animals need energy to live. We get our energy from
the food that we eat. Do you remember learning about food chains
in the beginning of the year in Life and Living?
QUdSThONS
.choose one of the foods that you will eat for lunch today and
draw a food chain including this food and ending with you.

eood contains stored energy that our bodies can change into
useful energy that we need when we run, jump, breathe, learn and
do everything else that we do.

Stored energy in fuels
So we can say that food is the
fuel for our bodies! h must need
a lot of fuel for my body as h love
being active!
The energy value of food is often shown on the packaging of foods
that we buy. The energy of food is measured either in calories
(cal) or in joules (i). a snack such as a packet of chips gives you
thousands of joules of energy. Therefore, we rather talk about
kilojoules (ki) of energy when talking about the energy in food.

The side of the packet contains a lot of information about what the
mealie meal contains. The very top line tells us that ��� g of mealie
meal will supply your body with ���� ki of energy.
The nutritional information on a mealie meal packet
The energy value of a food tells us how much energy that food is
worth to our bodies as fuel. an average adult man needs about
���� kcal or �� ��� ki per day. children and adults that are not
very active need less energy. People that are very active need
more energy. These numbers are just to give us an idea of the
amount of energy your body needs as fuel everyday.

dnergy and electricity
an electric circuit is a system that
consists of diﬀerent parts. We call
these parts the components of the
circuit. eor example, batteries, light
bulbs and connecting wires are
components that can make up a
circuit. When these components are
connected the right way, electricity
will be transferred from one
component to another. hn this
example, the electricity would be
transferred from the batteries
through the connecting wire to the
bulb and back through the wire to
the batteries to complete the circuit.
The chemical energy from
the battery is transferred to
electrical energy in the wires,
then electrical energy is
transferred into heat and
light energy in the bulb.

batteries are actually made up of smaller parts, known as cells, that
store chemical energy. Two or more cells connected end to end are
called a battery. We will mostly refer to them as batteries, but keep
in mind that 'cell' is the scientiﬁc term for what most people call a
battery in everyday life. One cell stores a small amount of energy.
hf we need to store a lot of energy we use a battery.
a car needs a lot of energy to
start its engine. One cell does
not have enough stored energy.
Therefore, a car battery has six
cells that are connected end to
end inside the battery case. hn
this case, there is six times more
energy stored in the battery
than in a single cell. This gives
the car enough energy to start
the engine.

.Why do you think wheels are round? Why will a square or a
triangular wheel not work?
gow did wheels and axles develop?
hn the past, before the wheel was invented, it was very diﬃcult to
move things around. People would try to drag heaving objects
along the ground using ropes, or else they had to carry things, but
this was very ineﬃcient! as a result, people started to experiment
with ways of making it easier to transport goods and heavy
objects.
The pyramids in dgypt were built long before modern transport
(including trucks) was invented.
The pyramids are very high structures made of stone. �
The dgyptians were very clever in ﬁnding ways to move very heavy
objects. They used logs that were laid down like in the picture. The
heavy objects were placed on them, rolling them creating
movement like in the picture.

The dgyptians used this method to move the massive blocks of
stone to build their pyramids. but, there were still many problems
with using logs cut from trees.

Later on, people started to cut the logs into short pieces so that
they were the same size. dach piece was like a wooden disc. The
wooden disc could not stand up by itself so people attached a
wooden pole between two of the wooden discs. The wooden pole
was the ﬁrst axle, and we still use axles to this day. That is how the
ﬁrst wheel and axle was developed!
People could then balance goods on the axle and use this simple
machine to pull or push objects along. gowever, this wooden disc
wheel was still very heavy! To make it lighter, the wheel was
changed to a round frame with spokes, like a wagon wheel. This
made it much lighter and easier to move. Since then, the wheel has
advanced a lot. Think of the shiny metal and rubber wheels you
see on cars today!

wheels and axles and ﬁnding out the best materials to use.
There are two ways to let wheels turn on an axle. One way is to
have the axle ﬁxed to the body, and the wheels are free to turn on
the axle. The other way is to have the wheels ﬁxed to the axle and
the axle turns in a bigger tube called the bearing. The bearing is
the hollow tube that the axle goes through. The bearing must be
bigger than the axle so that the axle can turn easily.
You can use plastic straws or the barrel of an old ball-point pen to
make a bearing for an axle. The picture shows you two ways to ﬁx
the bearings onto the body.

The darth moves
hn fr. � we learnt that the darth moves in two diﬀerent ways. The
darth orbits the Sun and the darth also spins on its own axis. Let's
revise these concepts again.
The darth spins on its axis, and so we have day and
night
You learnt that the darth spins on its axis. but what does this
mean? hmagine an orange with a pencil stuck through it. Look at
the following picture. hf you hold the pencil in your ﬁngers, you can
spin the orange around. The pencil is the axis of the orange.

We are on the darth. Let us imagine we are at the point where you
see the red "X" on the orange:
• The Sun shines on the darth and so we, at X, see the Sun. We
call that daytime.
• but the darth never stops spinning. So we, at X, move around
into the shaded part of the darth. Then we cannot see the
Sun any longer and it is nighttime for us at X.

The people in the submarines saw anemones
like this in the deepest part of the ocean. �
They found rocks that look like those in photograph. That means
the darth's crust rock lies under the oceans as well as under our
feet. The crust is a layer of rock all around the darth, like the shell
of a hard-boiled egg.
The mantle and the core lie even deeper under the
crust.
hf we go deeper than the crust, we go into rock called the mantle.
The mantle is the layer that lies underneath the crust. Mantle rock
is much hotter than the rock that is found in the crust. The rocks
are so hot that they are soft in some places, like toothpaste. The
hot rock pushes upwards against the crust. Where there is a weak
spot in the crust, the hot rock might burst through. This is how
volcanoes erupt. The mantle is � ��� km thick, so it is still a long

�. Water breaks up the surface of rocks
Soil contains a little water. The roots of plants can change this
water so that the water becomes an acid. Vinegar is an example of
an acid that we use in our everyday lives.
acid can work on stones to break them up. The acidic water breaks
the surface of the stone and then the stone can break more easily.
Rain water can also break up and wear down the surface of stones
causing small pieces to break oﬀ. We saw an example of this with
the water from the tap breaking up the cement.
Rain wears down rocks and causes smaller pieces to break oﬀ.
�. Stones rub together, and their surfaces break up
Stones rub together when water moves them, or when wind blows
them against bigger stones. People and animals walking on a path
kick stones and break oﬀ little pieces. Small stones become even
smaller, and eventually the very small pieces become sand.

Making soil
Rocks break down and slowly change into sand. This change
needs thousands of years to take place because soil, wind and
water do it very slowly. Sand is not soil. More changes must
happen to sand before it is soil.

�. Where do you think the insects come from?
The grey hairy things that you see growing in the vegetable peels
are fungi, and they help to break down the peels. There are many
kinds of fungi and they can have diﬀerent colours.
When you see insects in the compost column, they could come
from two places. They may be fruit ﬂies that can get in through the
air holes, but they may also be hatching from eggs that insects laid
in the peels and leaves before you put them into the plastic
bottles. Do you remember in the ﬁrst term when we did Life and
Living, we observed the life cycle of fruit ﬂies?
after about � weeks, your compost will be a dark colour and the
big pieces will have broken down into small pieces. You can pour
out the compost and mix an equal amount of sand with the
compost. Now you have made a little soil.
Microorganisms in the soil
When you looked at soil, you found sand grains, small bits of plants
and small bits of animals. but there was another group of things
you could not see, because they are too small. They are
microorganisms. They are living things that, in the soil, change
dead plant and animal material into substances that plants can use
and absorb through their roots.
hf we work hard, we can make a small amount of good topsoil in a
term. but a farmer needs good topsoil all over the farm. Nature
works all over the darth but it works very slowly. Nature needs
about � ��� years to make topsoil just �� cm deep. hf rain washes
away the topsoil the farmer cannot grow good crops on that land.

smaller or in between, and has a smaller portion of the other sizes.
Soil particles - Sand, silt and clay
There are � main types of particles which make up soil.

The types of soil
Sandy soil is the soil you ﬁnd at the beach. ht consists of large
gritty particles and very tiny bits of rock which we call grains of
sand. The grains of sand are coarse and the soil is loose.
can you see how, in the picture of sandy soil, the grains can fall
though your hand? ht does not retain fertilisers. ht is easily washed
or blown away. On sunny days sandy soil warms up quickly. Most
plants do not grow well in sandy soil.

the properties of clay.
clay can be moulded. This is because it consists mainly of very ﬁne
particles which cling together. clay becomes sticky when wet. ht

washed away. ht does not become as warm as sandy soil.

material from plants and animals which is decomposing.
Loam is fairly loose and fertile. ht retains fertilisers longer than
sandy soil. ht is not easily blown or washed away. ht is much cooler
than either sand or clayey soil. Loam soil is the best type of soil for
plants to grow in!
Loam soil is rich with humus. �

The wind is depositing sand in this corner of the school.
Deposition is happening here.
Sediments
When the sand grains collect on top of each other, they form a
sediment. Over time, new layers of mud and sand are deposited on
the previous layers. Over a very long time, these sediments
become compacted and hardened and become a sedimentary
rock. This happens because the grains of sand become glued
together, and other heavy sediments press down on the grains of
sand. Sediments lie on top of each other. We can actually see
these layers in sedimentary rock and they are sometimes diﬀerent

The sedimentary rock in the frand canyon formed a very long
time ago. The layers of sediment were once deposited in warm
shallow seas and over millions of years they compacted to form
rock. The wind and rain have eroded it until it looks like this.

rock is formed, mostly under the sea or lakes and rivers.

Sedimentary rocks
Diﬀerent kinds of sedimentary rock
There are many kinds of sedimentary rock. gere are three kinds:
�. Sandstone is made from grains of sand that are cemented
together.
�. Shale is made from grains of clay that are cemented together.
Shale is quite soft and you can use it to write with, like a piece
of chalk.
�. Limestone is made of layers of shells of sea-animals that died
and sank to the bottom of the sea. Other kinds of limestone
are made from sea-water evaporating.

form of limestone.

You just saw that there are diﬀerent types of sedimentary rocks.
These rock types are used in diﬀerent ways.
Limestone
Limestone is a very common sedimentary rock and it has many
uses, mostly as building materials.
Limestone is cut into blocks and used in buildings. Look at these
pictures below of diﬀerent buildings made from limestone.

sand to make the glass stronger. earmers use limestone to improve
their soil, if the soil is too acidic.
Limestone is even used in some medicines and cosmetics and as a
white pigment in toothpaste, paints and plastics!
Sandstone
Sandstone has been a popular building material since ancient
times, especially in houses and cathedrals around the world. This is
because it is quite soft and easy to carve. gouses in Lesotho and
the eree State were built from sandstone blocks.

Sandstone comes in many diﬀerent colours and so it is often used
in decoratively, such as in decorative stones, in ﬁreplaces, in
decorative columns and pillars in buildings and cathedrals and to
make statues and fountains. Since sandstone is easy to carve, but
does not weather, it is often used as paving stones and to make
walkways.

Shale
Shale is also used in buildings, especially as a raw material to make
bricks. Shale also splits very easily into thin sheets and is therefore
used as as tiles for ﬂoors and roofs. Shale is used for ﬂoors in some
houses in South africa.

These old photographs are of fossil hunters! These people are
splitting open pieces of shale. They are looking for fossils in the
rock. The layers of the shale split apart, and occasionally reveal the
shape of a leaf or an animal in the rock. The shape is called a fossil.
all over the world, people ﬁnd fossils of leaves and bones in the
layers of sedimentary rock. These leaves and bones came from
plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. They were not
like the plants and animals we see today.
..
DID YOU KNOW?
a paleontologist is a
scientist who studies
prehistoric life, mostly
by looking at fossils.
.
eossils are the preserved remains of dead plants and
animals
a fossil may look the same as the plant or animal when it was alive,
but it is not the real leaf or bone you see. The fossil has changed to
stone through a special process, and the stone has kept the shape
of the leaf or the bone. This rock shape is called a fossil, or a body
fossil.
below you can see a photo of a fossil of the head of a dinosaur,
and the next image shows you what scientists think this dinosaur
looked like.

This fossil of the dinosaur's head is not the actual bones, but it is
actually now a rock in the shape of the dinosaur's bones. Over
millions of years, the bones turned into rock. So, a fossil is the
remains of an ancient plant or animal which has been preserved in
a rock. Most of the organisms that paleontologists study are now
extinct. This means that they are no longer alive today.

Why are fossils so important?
The darth's past is fascinating to us! hmagine being around when
all the dinosaurs were walking on darth. as humans, we want to
ﬁnd out about Life's gistory on darth.
hn recent history, we have books written that record what
happened. This means we can read what people who lived long
ago wrote about that time period. but no human was around
millions of years ago to record what happened then!
So we have to use other ways to ﬁnd out about what life was like
on darth millions of years ago. To do this, scientists use fossils!

chapter �.
eossils
eossils are actually our most valuable source of information about
the ancient past!
but what can fossils tell us about life long ago? eossils tell us about
the organisms that lived long ago. hmagine the ﬁrst scientists that
discovered a dinosaurs bones! These bones were much bigger than
the bones of any other animal on darth today! This immediately
told the scientists that the animals from the past were really big!
The bones of the Tyrannosaurus Rex tell us that is was very, very big!

eossils can tell us much more than just which organisms lived
millions of years ago. by studying fossils of plants and animals,
scientists can also gather information on how these organisms
grew, what they ate, the environment they lived in and even some
aspects of their behaviour and how they interacted!
eor example, studying fossilised faeces of an animal can give
evidence about what an animal used to eat.
by working out which plants used to grow during a particular time
period in darth's history, scientists can work out what the climate
was like during that time. We now know when there were ice ages
where the whole darth was covered in ice for thousands of years,
and when it was warmer and there were droughts.

The layers of rock which are lower down will be the oldest as they
were deposited ﬁrst. So the fossils in these layers will be from
earlier times than fossils in rock layers which are closer to the
surface.
gow did the bodies of animals and plants get into the
rock?
gave you perhaps seen the body of a dead bird? Dogs, ﬂies, ants
and beetles all take away the parts of the body. The wind blows
away the feathers and soon there is nothing left to see.
but sometimes it does not happen like that. hmagine an animal
died in a river. There was a ﬂood and the river quickly covered the
body with sand. hn years after that, more ﬂoods brought more
sand and put it on top. The heavy sand pressed down on the
bottom sediments. Slowly, the bottom sediments became
sedimentary rock.
Let's try make our own model to understand how fossils are
formed in sedimentary rock!

.acThVhTY: gow to make a model of a body fossil
eossil-hunters look for fossils in sedimentary rock. They never
know whether they will ﬁnd a fossil or not. They have to split open
the rock layers to see any fossil. You are going to make a model of
some rock that you will split open.
MaTdRhaLS:
• small container: a plastic dish that you can cut up, or the
bottom of a milk carton
• a leaf with ribs that stand out, or
• an animal bone, for example, a chicken bone
• a little Vaseline
• plaster of Paris
hNSTRUcThONS:
dach group must make a model rock with a fossil.
Day One:
�. eirst, spread Vaseline over the back of your leaf, or your
chicken bone.
�. Next, take your cardboard container to your teacher. Pour the
fresh plaster of Paris mixture into the container. The plaster of
Paris will begin to set hard in about �� minutes, so you must
be ready with your bone of leaf.
�. Now put your leaf or bone onto the top of the wet plaster of
Paris, and press it gently into the plaster. The bone must go in
only half-way as you see in in the picture below. The leaf must
go only far enough to leave the shapes of its ribs in the plaster.
�. Leave the plaster to set (to get hard). Notice how hot your
container becomes while the plaster is setting.

Press the bone only half-way into the plaster.
Day Two:
�. eirst, pull out the leaf or the bone. ht will come out easily
because the plaster does not stick onto the Vaseline.
�. Now you have an impression of the leaf or the bone. an
impression is like a footprint in mud.
�. Next, spread a very thin layer of Vaseline into the impression
and around the impression, as you see in the picture below.
When you pull the leaf or bone out, you leave an impression in the hard
plaster. Smear Vaseline into the impression and around it.
�. Then collect some runny wet plaster of Paris from your
teacher and pour it over the Vaseline to cover the old plaster
and ﬁll the container almost to the top. Let the new plaster
set for a day.

��. Use the knife to tap gently on the edge of the 'rock'. Use a
stick to tap on the back of the knife blade, so that you do not
hit too hard.
You should ﬁnd a cast of the bone.
��. Your 'rock' should split open if you tap in the right place.
When it splits open, you will see a cast of a leaf or a bone on
the top layer. The cast has the shape of the impression, but
the impression goes inward and the cast stands up.

Look at the pictures below and read the explanations for each
stage of the fossil formation process.
Long, long ago, a dinosaur dies on the banks of a river, such as this
triceratops in the picture.
The ﬂesh of the dinosaur decomposes, or other animals eat it. So,
only the skeleton remains.
There was a ﬂood and the river rose and covered the skeleton with
mud and sand.
.
..
���
.
chapter �.
eossils
Over time, more ﬂoods deposit more layers of sand and mud over
the skeleton. Over thousands of years, the bottom layers start to
become compacted and turn into sedimentary rock. Under the
ground, water carried substances from rock into each little space
where a bone had been. Rock took the place of bone. We say the
bones were fossilised. a fossil bone has the same shape as the
original bone but much heavier.
Millions of years later, the conditions of the environment above the
skeleton may change. The rock is eroded and weathered over time
by wind and water and the fossil is exposed on the surface. a
scientist sees the fossil and a great discovery is made!
Other scientists join in and they excavate the fossil by carefully
removing the rock and sand around the skeleton. The fossils will be
carefully packed and taken to a museum or research centre where
the scientists will study them to see what they can learn about
prehistoric life. They will try to reassemble the bones into a full
skeleton - this may take many months to do!

We have seen many diﬀerent fossils so far in this chapter. These
fossils can be divided into two groups:
�. body fossils
�. Trace fossils
a body fossil shows you the shape of the body of the plant or
animal. body fossils include teeth, bones, shells, stems, leaves and
seeds.
Sometimes an animal left only a sign that it has been there. eor
example, if you walk across wet cement, you might leave a
footprint which will be preserved in the cement when it hardens.
Look at the picture below.
a footprint which has hardened in
the cement �
a dinosaur left its footprints in the
mud, and the mud turned to rock.
This is a trace fossil. �
We said that body fossils are the preserved remains of the body of
an animal or plant. So what about things like fossilised footprints?
eossils of footprints, egg shells, and nests, for example, are all
remains of the activity of an animal. We call these trace fossils.
